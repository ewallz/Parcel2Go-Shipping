Intergration with WooCommerce to allow shipping items via a Parcel2Go.com account
 
== Description ==
 
Save time and money today by using Parcel2Go's shipping plugin!

What does it do? 

Without every leaving your WooCommerce/Word Press store, you can get an instant quote to send your sold products out to your customers.

Each generated quote will give you a wide array of options to compare and choose from. These options include Courier Companies, Time of Delivery, Drop Off or Courier Pick Up and much more.

It's quick, simple, and free!

How does it work? 

When an order is 'processing', an extra option will become available in the 'WooCommerce Orders' table for 'Sending with Parcel2Go'. Choosing this option will quickly and automatically take you through to the Parcel2Go quote page to start your order process.

Once a service is chosen and paid for - using Parcel2Go prepay - the order will then be marked as 'Complete', which means you'll be able to download your label for shipping and have access to the most recent tracking event from your order page!
